3. Python Syntax and Semantics:
   - Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.
# This is a Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

# The print() function prints a message to the console.
print("Hello, World!")
Basic syntax elements used in the program:

Comments: Comments are used to annotate the program and make it easier to understand. They start with the "#" character and end at the end of the line.
Statements: Statements are the basic building blocks of a Python program. They are used to perform actions, such as printing a message to the console.
Expressions: Expressions are used to compute values. The expression in this program is "Hello, World!".
Keywords: Keywords are special words that have a specific meaning in Python. The keyword in this program is "print".
Identifiers: Identifiers are used to name variables and functions. The identifier in this program is "print".















4. Data Types and Variables:
   - List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.
Basic Data Types in Python

| Data Type | Description | |---|---| | Integer | Represents whole numbers. | | Float | Represents decimal numbers. | | String | Represents a sequence of characters enclosed in single ('') or double ("") quotes. | | Boolean | Represents True or False values. | | None | A special value indicating the absence of a value. |

Short Script Demonstrating Variables of Different Data Types

# Defining variables of different data types
integer_var = 10
float_var = 3.14
string_var = "Hello World"
boolean_var = True
none_var = None

# Printing the variables
print("Integer: ", integer_var)
print("Float: ", float_var)
print("String: ", string_var)
print("Boolean: ", boolean_var)
print("None: ", none_var)
Output:

Integer:  10
Float:  3.14
String:  Hello World
Boolean:  True
None:  None
























5. Control Structures:
   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.
   Conditional Statements
Conditional statements allow you to execute different code based on whether a certain condition is met. The most common conditional statement in Python is the
if-else
statement.

Syntax:

if condition:
    # Code to execute if condition is True
else:
    # Code to execute if condition is False
Example:

if x > 0:
    print("x is positive")
else:
    print("x is non-positive")
Loops
Loops allow you to iterate over a collection of items and execute a block of code for each item. The most common loop in Python is the
for
loop.

Syntax:

for item in collection:
    # Code to execute for each item
Example:

for number in range(1, 11):
    print(number)
Combining Conditional Statements and Loops
Conditional statements and loops can be combined to create more complex programs. For example, the following program uses a
for
loop to iterate over a list of numbers and an
if-else
statement to print whether each number is odd or even:

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

for number in numbers:
    if number % 2 == 0:
        print(f"{number} is even")
    else:
        print(f"{number} is odd")







6. Functions in Python:
   - What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.
What are Functions in Python?

Functions in Python are reusable blocks of code that encapsulate a specific task. They allow you to write more modular and organized code by breaking down your program into smaller, manageable units.

Why Are Functions Useful?

Functions offer several benefits:

Code Reusability: Functions can be reused multiple times throughout the program, eliminating the need to write repetitive code.
Organization: By grouping related code into functions, you can make your program easier to read and understand.
Modularity: Functions allow you to divide your program into self-contained units, making it more flexible and adaptable.
Encapsulation: Functions hide the implementation details of a task, allowing you to focus on the functionality it provides.
Testing: Functions make it easier to test individual components of your program.
Creating a Function

To create a function in Python, use the
def
keyword followed by the function name and parentheses. Inside the function, write the code you want to execute. The function must be indented by one level.

def function_name(argument1, argument2):
    """Docstring: Brief description of the function"""
    # Function body
Example Function

Here's a simple function that takes two arguments and returns their sum:

def add_numbers(num1, num2):
    """Add two numbers and return their sum."""
    return num1 + num2
Calling a Function

To call a function, simply use its name followed by the appropriate arguments in parentheses.

# Example of calling the add_numbers function
result = add_numbers(5, 10)
print(result)  # Output: 15
In this example, the
add_numbers
function is called with the arguments
5
and
10
. The result, which is
15
, is printed to the console.













7. Lists and Dictionaries:
   - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.
 Feature | List | Dictionary | |---|---|---| | Data Structure | Ordered collection of elements | Unordered collection of key-value pairs | | Indexing | Access elements using indices (0-based) | Access values using keys | | Mutability | Elements can be added, removed, or modified | Keys and values can be added, removed, or modified | | Duplicates | Elements can be repeated within a list | Keys in a dictionary must be unique |

Script Demonstrating Basic Operations on Lists and Dictionaries

# Create a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Create a dictionary with some key-value pairs
words = {"one": 1, "two": 2, "three": 3}

# Access an element from the list using its index
print(numbers[2])  # Output: 3

# Access a value from the dictionary using its key
print(words["two"])  # Output: 2

# Add an element to the list
numbers.append(6)

# Add a key-value pair to the dictionary
words["four"] = 4

# Iterate over the list using a for loop
for number in numbers:
    print(number)

# Iterate over the dictionary using a for loop
for key, value in words.items():
    print(f"{key}: {value}")

# Remove an element from the list using its index
del numbers[1]

# Remove a key-value pair from the dictionary using its key
del words["one"]

# Check if an element exists in the list
print(1 in numbers)  # Output: False

# Check if a key exists in the dictionary
print("one" in words)  # Output: False















8. Exception Handling:
   - What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.
Exception handling refers to the mechanism that allows programs to handle errors or unexpected conditions during execution. In Python, exception handling is performed using the following blocks:

try: The try block contains the code that might throw an exception.
except: The except block specifies what actions should be taken when an exception occurs.
finally: The finally block contains code that will always be executed, regardless of whether an exception occurs or not.
Example

Suppose you have a script that reads user input and performs some calculations. If the user enters an invalid input (e.g., a non-numeric value), the script would crash without proper exception handling.

Here's an example of how to use
try
,
except
, and
finally
blocks to handle this error:

try:
    # Code that might throw an exception
    user_input = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    result = user_input / 0
except ValueError:
    # Handle the exception (e.g., invalid input)
    print("Invalid input. Please enter a number.")
finally:
    # Always execute this code, regardless of errors
    print("Thank you for using the script.")
In this example:

The
try
block contains the code that might throw an exception, which is reading the user input and attempting to convert it to an integer.
The
except
block specifies that if a
ValueError
(e.g., invalid input) occurs, the code within the
except
block will be executed.
The
finally
block contains code that will always be executed, regardless of whether an exception occurs or not. In this case, it prints a thank you message.
When the script runs, it will attempt to convert the user input to an integer. If the user enters a non-numeric value, a
ValueError
will be thrown, and the
except
block will be executed, printing the error message. The
finally
block will then be executed to display the thank you message.

















9. Modules and Packages:
   - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.
In Python, a module is a file containing Python definitions and statements.
It can contain functions, classes, variables, and other objects.
Modules are used to organize and structure Python code.
They allow code reuse and modularity.
Packages

A package is a collection of related modules.
It provides a hierarchical way to organize and manage code.
Packages are typically stored in directories, with each directory containing a module.
Importing Modules

To use a module in your script, you need to import it using the
import
statement. The following syntax is used:

import module_name
This statement imports the specified module and makes its contents available to your script.

Using Imported Modules

Once a module is imported, you can access its contents using the dot operator (
.
). For example, if you import the
math
module, you can access its
pi
constant as follows:

import math
result = math.pi
Example: Using the
math
Module

Here is an example of how you can import and use the
math
module in your Python script:

# Import the math module
import math

# Calculate the square root of 9
result = math.sqrt(9)

# Print the result
print(result)  # Output: 3.0
In this example, we import the
math
module and use its
sqrt()
function to calculate the square root of 9. The result is then printed to the console.











10. File I/O:
    - How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.
Reading from a File
To read from a file in Python, you can use the
open()
function to open the file and then use the
read()
method to read its contents. For example:

with open('my_file.txt', 'r') as f:
    contents = f.read()
print(contents)
This will read the contents of the file
my_file.txt
and print them to the console. The
with
statement ensures that the file is closed properly even if an exception occurs.

Writing to a File
To write to a file in Python, you can use the
open()
function to open the file and then use the
write()
method to write data to it. For example:

with open('my_file.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write('Hello, world!')
This will write the string
Hello, world!
to the file
my_file.txt
. The
w
mode opens the file for writing, and if the file does not exist, it will be created.

Script to Read from a File
The following script reads the contents of a file and prints them to the console:

filename = input('Enter the name of the file to read: ')

with open(filename, 'r') as f:
    contents = f.read()

print(contents)
Script to Write to a File
The following script writes a list of strings to a file:

filename = input('Enter the name of the file to write to: ')
strings = ['Hello', 'world!', 'This', 'is', 'a', 'list', 'of', 'strings.']

with open(filename, 'w') as f:
    for string in strings:
        f.write(string + '\n')
